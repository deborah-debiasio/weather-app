# Weather Information Management
This documentation outlines the functionality of the application's weather information management system, allowing users to maintain a list of cities and retrieve both current and historical weather data.

Users have the capability to manage a list of cities within the application, enabling them to access real-time and historical weather information for those locations. The historical weather data includes all weather requests previously made by the user through the application.
Clicking the button "Add city" users can add or remove city names. 

All the temperatures are in Celsius.
